# Downloads the rules engine WASM binary from the schematic-api GitHub Release.
# Reads the pinned version from WASM_VERSION at the repo root.
#
# Unlike the other Schematic SDKs, the binary this fetches IS tracked in git.
# Those SDKs gitignore it and inject it during a publish step (npm tarball, nupkg,
# wheel, gem, jar). Go has no publish step: `go get` serves a module's source tree
# straight from the git tag via the module proxy, and //go:embed requires the file
# to exist at compile time -- so a gitignored binary would simply not reach
# consumers. schematic-api is private besides, so consumers could not fetch it
# themselves even if Go had install hooks.
#
# This script therefore regenerates the committed binary rather than being a
# prerequisite for building. CI runs it and then diffs the result (see
# .github/workflows/wasm.yml), so the committed binary is verified against
# WASM_VERSION rather than trusted.
